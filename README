NAME

    List::Zip - Module to zip lists.

DESCRIPTION

    Provides functionality to zip lists. The provided subroutine returns a list formed from
    the input lists.

    List::MoreUtils also provides functionality to mesh lists. However, this implementation
    differs. If the lists passed to zip have different sizes all the the lists will be truncated to
    the same size as the smallest list.

SYNOPSIS

    use List::Zip;

    my @zipped = List::Zip->zip(
        [ 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 ], [ 'one', 'two', 'three', 'four', 'five' ]
    );

    say $zipped[0]->[0]; # 1
    say $zipped[0]->[1]; # one
    say $zipped[1]->[0]; # 2
    say $zipped[1]->[1]; # two

    # We can get back to the original structure before zipping by zipping
    # the list again with no additional lists
    my @unzipped = List::Zip->zip(@zipped);

    say for @{ $unzipped[0] }; # 1 2 3 4 5
    say for @{ $unzipped[1] }; # one two three four five

METHODS

    zip - Converts this list by combining corresponding elements from the input lists into lists.

        my $zipped = List::Zip->zip([ 1 .. 5 ], [ 6 .. 10 ]);

    The structure of the list returned by zipping the above is:

        [ 1, 6 ], [ 2, 7 ], [ 3, 8 ], [ 4, 9 ], [ 5, 10 ]

EXPORTS

    None. Methods provided by this module are class methods so should be invoked
    by the class.
