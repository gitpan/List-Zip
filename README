NAME

    List::Zip - Module to zip and unzip lists.

DESCRIPTION

    Provides subroutines to zip and unzip lists. Each subroutine provided returns a list formed
    from the input lists.

    List::MoreUtils also provides functionality to mesh lists. However, this implementation
    differs. If the lists passed to zip or unzip have different sizes all the the lists will
    be truncated to the same size as the smallest list.

SYNOPSIS

    use List::Zip;

    my @zipped = List::Zip->zip(
        [ 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 ], [ 'one', 'two', 'three', 'four', 'five' ]
    );

    say $zipped[0]->[0]; # 1
    say $zipped[0]->[1]; # one
    say $zipped[1]->[0]; # 2
    say $zipped[1]->[1]; # two

    my @unzipped = List::Zip->unzip(@zipped);

    say for @{ $unzipped[0] }; # 1 2 3 4 5
    say for @{ $unzipped[1] }; # one two three four five

METHODS

    zip   - Converts this list by combining corresponding elements from the input lists into lists.

                my $zipped = List::Zip->zip([ 1 .. 5], [ 6 .. 10 ]);

            The structure of the list returned by zipping the above is:

                [ 1, 6 ], [ 2, 7 ], [ 3, 8 ], [ 4, 9 ], [ 5, 10 ]

    unzip - Converts this list into multiple lists, each containing the corresponding elements from
            each of the input lists.

                my @unzipped = List::Zip->unzip(
                    [ 1, 'one', 'a' ], [ 2 , 'two', 'b' ], [ 3, 'three', 'c' ]
                );

            The structure of the list returned by unzipping the above is:

                [ 1, 2, 3 ], [ 'one', 'two', 'three' ], [ 'a', 'b' ,'c' ]

EXPORTS

    None. Methods provided by this module are class methods so should be invoked
    by the class.
